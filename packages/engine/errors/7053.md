You're likely inside a loop, trying to access an object property with a string literal containing an index.

```ts
interface myObject {
  value1?: string | undefined
  value2?: string | undefined
}

const anObject: myObject = {};

const arr = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];

arr.forEach((val, index) => {
  anObject[`value${index + 1}`] = val; ❌
});
```

But right now, I dont know if the string literal points to an invalid object key, due to the variable being the incrementing index. It could be `anObject.value3` which does not exist on the type.

```ts
type T = keyof typeof anObject;

arr.forEach((val, index) => {
  anObject[(`value${index + 1}` as T)] = val; ✅
});
```

The reason this is showing as an error is because you've got `"strict": true` in your TS Config.
